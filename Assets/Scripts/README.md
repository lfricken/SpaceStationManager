On the left is the net gas movement per tile, the middle is the pressure per tile, and the right is a 1d cross section of the bottom row of tiles so you can get a better idea for how shockwaves dissipate and bounce off walls. The whole thing is contained in a box, and there is a small wall (black line) at the bottom which you can see in the middle box. It all runs on the Graphics card and thus can handle a 512x512 grid at over 300 simulation ticks per second (300 fps) on my pc at least.
